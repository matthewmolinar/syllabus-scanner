          Traditional education software is built for administrators - not students. 
          We strive to correct this trend, for in this newly-minted digital transition that was expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic,
          students are faced with new demands to continue their academic success, 
          and this means new tools to assist in their academic endeavors, and hereâ€™s how we plan to do it:

              description="We plan to build our software with a student-first philosophy. 
              By having direct contact with our student users, we plan to leverage the feedback 
              we get from these users to cater to the specific needs presented by students 
              in the form of new and innovative software solutions."
